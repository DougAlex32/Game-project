 When you start the game you can you will use the arrows to navigate the character to the target. Except in my case it's a story of navigating throughoout the late nights of LA. you wanna run home to safety as fas as you with out getting caught of hurt by the bad guys beware of the alley sometimes you might get stuck!

## Game-Devlop
Its was based of the old school game Legend of Zelda (16 bit) where you try to find your way around the map to get to the target while avoiding obstacles. I wanted something simple and fun. 
 
## Code

This was one of the toughest parts for figuring out my obstacles and how to make them render and how to make them work properly.

This part of the code was a bit tricky trying to make sure that all your movement worked properly 


### Unsloved Problems
Sometimes when the game renders you get caught inside the obstacles and have to reset the game or sometimes in the game it can happpen as well while your chasing the target.


## Stretch Goal
Hopefully be able to render some characters and be able to move quicker and not have those few glitches.
